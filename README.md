# w2v_cosines

This is a python notebook with cosine similarity calculations of word pairs using word2vec.

The model is trained on children's environmental inputs, obtained from [here](https://github.com/benjamincmorris/Semantic-Networks/tree/master/corpora). This data comes from the CHILDES project.

The ipython notebook code requires installing [this](https://github.com/danielfrg/word2vec) python wrapper to Google's word2vec C library.

N.B. w2v_semcat_cosines.csv provides the cosine similarities for test items used in an experiment of semantic specificity (Bergelson & Aslin, under review); wt2_sixmonth_cosines.csv does the same for stimuli for another study (in prep).
